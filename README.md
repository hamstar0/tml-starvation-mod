# Starvation

Players now lose health if they do not have the Well Fed buff active. This buff now expires 4x as quickly as normal, increasing in rate proportion to your max health. Configurable.

NEW! (as of v1.3): Food spoilage is now an option in the config settings. Set `"FoodSpoilageEnabled": true` to enable. IMPORTANT: Due to a limitation with tModLoader, ALL food items are restricted to stacks of 1 with this. All existing food stacks will be permanently unstackable (but retain their quantity). You have been warned.

NEW! (as of v1.4): Added Unlife Crystals. Reduces max hp by 20. Returns a Life Crystal on use.
